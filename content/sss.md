Will Allen-Mersh

Will Allen-Mersh is in charge of marketing at Spill, a small startup with a big dream - to make talking therapy available to anyone with an internet connection. The team behind Spill wants to break down barriers and stigma surrounding mental health issues and make talking therapy something that everyone does every day.

After graduating from Oxford University and Miami Ad School, Will has spent eight years working with brands. His experience spans all the way from new brand creation to global campaigns for multinationals, and he has worked for a range of advertising agencies such as Adam&eveDDB (AdAge’s International Agency of the Year) across clients including BMW, Tesco, Unilever, Johnson&Johnson and Harvey Nichols. Last year his behavioural-change campaign for Persil, which got over 200,000 kids playing outdoors whilst boosting sales, received awards from the APG, Marketing Society and Cannes Lions.

Katerina Spranger

Dr Katerina Spranger is the founder of Oxford Heartbeat - a start-up company that develops medical device software to make planning for surgeries simpler, faster and more accurate. Katerina is an Enterprise Fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering and holds a PhD in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford. She was named “Young Innovator of the Year 2013” at the Falling Walls Berlin - International Conference on Future Breakthrough in Science and Society. 

Her company successfully attracted funding from the Innovate UK, NIHR, SBRI, EIT Health, etc., and received numerous awards for their innovative technology, including the NHS Innovation Award 2017 from HEE and WIRED “Best Healthcare Startup of 2018".

Lorin Gresser

Dr Lorin Gresser trained as a doctor at King College Medical school. She has a particular interest in immunology and autoimmune disease. As well as leading the specialty contributor team, Dr Gresser is the CEO of Dem Dx.

Dem Dx offers a transparent, step by step, decision making process for healthcare professionals to use in training and when caring for patients. Dem Dx guides the user from the presenting symptoms through to a diagnosis, enabling medical students and clinicians to take a more structured and reasoned approach to clinical care, avoiding unnecessary investigations, treatment and missed diagnoses. It combines the power of unique medical algorithms, which are verified by artificial intelligence and decades of clinical experience to provide a transparent, clear reasoning process based on clinical signs, symptoms, and historical evidence.


Saqib Mukhtar

Dr Saqib Mukhtar is a healthtech innovator, GP, and telemedicine specialist. He is closely involved in MediChain, a Medical Big-Data Platform. MediChain’s proposed system allows patients to store their own medical data off-chain in an appropriate geographic domain.
It not only allows them to share it with doctors and specialists anywhere, regardless of the payer network or EMR used, but also allows them to share it anonymously with researchers, providing Big Data to facilitate treatment development.
He is also the founder of Watdoc, an online platform revolutionising the locum economy by direct engagement thus helping to reduce the over £3 billion spend by the NHS on the recruitment of temporary agency staff.
