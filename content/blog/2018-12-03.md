# New E-skin Nearly as Sensitive as Real One

Researchers from Stanford University have created an electronic skin that can measure slight pressures and even the direction in which they are applied, which gives enough information to robotic fingers to manipulate soft and squishy objects without damaging them.

# New male contraceptive gel under development

National Institute of Health (NIH) is to fund a clinical trial to evaluate a new contraceptive technology for men to shoulder some more responsibility for birth control and to reduce unwanted pregnancies. The NES/T gel is put on a man’s back and shoulders, where it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. It contains segesterone, which blocks testes from producing testosterone, which will reduce sperm production to low to nonexistent levels.
