# Glaucoma drainage device uses magnetic field for self-cleaning
Glaucoma is a common eye condition in which the optic nerve is damaged, usually due to the buildup of fluid in the front part of the eye. A prototype of a new drainage device may improve the durability of the surgical implants as they currently have limited lifespan due to a buildup of microorganisms. An externally applied magnetic field can break the blockage apart as well as vary flow resistance, which will allow for customerised treatment of glaucoma.

# Review says Babylon’s AI claims lack of “convincing evidence
Human doctors are yet to be beaten by AI. Babylon has been developing an AI diagnostic and triage system, which they claim to be “on-par with human doctors”. However, it has been received with scepticism, and researchers said that there are some methodological concerns in the study and in any realistic situation, the AI system may perform significantly worse. Further clinical evaluation is necessary to ensure confidence in patient’s safety.

# Lincolnshire STP signs deal with Cambio to help predict demand
A sustainability and transformation Partnership (STP) in Lincolnshire has signed a deal with Cambio Healthcare Systems for real-time dashboards to help forecast capacity and demand.
By identifying the pressure points in the system, it will allow the healthcare providers to react proactively, for instance by redistributing human/ medical resources. This aims to coordinate care across Lincolnshire so that all providers can respond quickly and appropriately to the changes in demand.

# Flexible LED sensor monitors blood oxygenation levels through skin
Researchers at University of California Berkeley have developed a flexible sensor that can be placed on the skin to measure levels of blood oxygenation over a large area. The device could help in tracking wound healing, or in monitoring oxygenation levels in transplanted skin or organs.
